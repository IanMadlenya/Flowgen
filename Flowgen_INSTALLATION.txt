LLVM+Clang installation. Change of default Python bindings to Python 3.

checkout LLVM
checkout clang
export CC=you_favorite_C_compiler
export CXX=your_favorite_C++_compiler
configure with --enable-optimized flag
make
Then copy paste the python 3 binding libraries in the corresponding directory
If not set, set the environment variables: 
$PYTHONPATH=user_path_to_llvm/llvm/tools/clang/bindings/python/
(the previous path points to the sources of llvm)
$LD_LIBRARY_PATH=user_path_to_llvm/build/Release+Asserts/lib
(the previous path points to the built llvm system. To get the folder Release+Asserts one does need to use the --enable-optimized flag when configuring)

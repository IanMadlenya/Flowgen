     <b>Flowgen generates high-level workflow diagrams from C++ annotated sources.</b>
     <br><br>
     Modern high-performance computing often involves fairly complex algorithms written in C++. This complexity comes, roughly speaking, from two aspects: the high-level (abstract) design, and the details of the specific code implementation. Code developers would like to disentangle the two. Software documentation for developers does not however offer a human-understandable, high-level overview of what the code actually <em>does</em>. It also fails to keep this overview up to date with the code. Good coding standards and strategies such as code modularity surely help, but cannot substitute for this high-level overview.
     <br><br>
     As a matter of fact, most codes include comments on the actions being performed in the neighboring lines. Our proposal is to promote them: upgrade them and bring them out. Given that a C++ program has a beginning and an end, both in the <code>main()</code> function, we can collect together these actions plus additional information on the control structures in order to form what is known as a <em>workflow</em>. Moreover, the same idea can apply to code substructures such as other functions than <code>main()</code>, or class methods (member functions). Here we will be dealing with a <em>high-level</em> workflow (technically a <em>UML activity diagram</em> [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activity_diagram">wikipedia</a>]), in close relation to the high-level design, implying that its actions are written down in a human language, by the code architects/developers, rather than machine-generated C++ statements. The open source Flowgen tool can generate a high-level workflow diagram for each annotated function on the C++ sources.  
     <br><br>
     Flowgen builds on the methodology of <a href="http://www.doxygen.org">Doxygen</a>, the de facto standard tool for generating documentation from annotated C++ sources, so that source code and workflow diagrams are bound together and easy to maintain consistent. Doxygen provides <em>structural</em> information, and Flowgen <em>behavioral</em> one; they are thus complementary. Flowgen is currently being applied to the <a href=http://vincia.hepforge.org">VINCIA code</a>, a plug-in to the high-energy physics event generator PYTHIA 8, used to simulate proton-proton collisions at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.
     <br><br><br>
     In this website we present the annotations grammar (INPUT) and the resulting workflow diagrams (OUTPUT) that are generated with Flowgen. The specifications for this annotations grammar exist in the Extended Backus-Naur Form, .EBNF format. Download the current file from <a href="docs/activityDiabrams.ebnf"> this link </a>[To be revised]. In order to visualize conveniently the .EBNF format, one can use the software <a href="http://ebnfvisualizer.sourceforge.net/">EBNF Visualizer</a>.
